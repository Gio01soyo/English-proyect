          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hello! We are Alex, Gio and Skarlet and this is our English IV final project. I will talk about my favorite anime, My Hero Academia, and show how it connects to my hobbies, my daily life, and my plans for the future. You will see how I used grammar structures from English IV—like present simple, past simple, used to, and passive voice—in every section.</p>

          <h2>Our Hobbies and Free Time</h2>
          <p>We love watching My Hero Academia in our free time. We usually stream two episodes each weekend and participate in an online fan community where new theories are shared. Besides anime, some team members play football together, while others enjoy drawing fan art of characters like Midoriya and All Might. We used to play video games as our main hobby when we were younger, but now we spend more time discussing plot developments and creating cosplay ideas.</p>

          <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
          <p>Last year, we discovered My Hero Academia because some members of our team recommended it to the rest. We were used to watching only Western cartoons, so we were all surprised by the Japanese animation style. We remember that many of our weekends were spent reading the manga together, and we even attended our first cosplay event as a group. The experience was unforgettable because we met other fans who inspired us and strengthened our teamwork.</p>

          <h2>My Daily Routine</h2>
          <p>On weekdays, we wake up early and check if a new episode of My Hero Academia has been released. Some of us go to school or work from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., and afterwards we review our English IV notes together. In the evenings, we do our homework and then stream one episode before our group study session. Watching My Hero Academia helps us relax, and we often pause to take notes on interesting character interactions and discuss them over chat.</p>

          <h2>Future Goals</h2>
          <p>We plan to continue integrating advanced grammar with interactive design. We aim to create more multimedia content, such as videos and infographics, to make English learning engaging. We will explore deeper thematic analyses of My Hero Academia and apply passive and future structures in our descriptions of upcoming projects.</p>

          <h2>Breaking News</h2>
          <p><strong>BREAKING NEWS: The Hero Society Under Pressure!</strong></p>
          <p>Today, we’re going deeper into the story of <em>My Hero Academia</em>. The League of Villains is planning a major attack, and U.A. students are getting ready for anything. Their lives are about to change forever.</p>
          <p><strong>💡 Cause Tip:</strong> If society creates too many rules, villains might rise to fight against them.</p>
          <p>U.A. students like Bakugo, Todoroki, and Uraraka have shown amazing progress. Special internships are being assigned, so heroes-in-training must choose wisely. They mustn’t underestimate real combat. Even a single mistake can get punished.</p>
          <p><strong>🔁 Zero Conditional:</strong> If a villain attacks, heroes respond immediately.<br>
          <strong>🔮 First Conditional:</strong> If the students pass the Provisional License Exam, they’ll be allowed to save civilians legally.</p>
          <p>But not everything is about fighting. Students have to manage friendships, doubts, and expectations. They don’t have to agree with every hero agency's philosophy, but they must learn from experience.</p>
          <p><strong>💭 Second Conditional:</strong> If Midoriya didn’t admire All Might so much, he wouldn’t push himself that hard.</p>
          <p>Now, a new villain group called the Paranormal Liberation Front has been formed, and their goal is dangerous. If they succeed, the hero society will be destroyed. Students like Midoriya are being tested mentally and emotionally.</p>
          <p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> If someone is fighting for the wrong cause, it might be because no one believed in them when they needed it most.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Endeavor, the new No. 1 Hero, has been given a huge responsibility. He has to protect people while repairing his broken relationship with his family. His past mistakes shouldn’t be forgotten, but his current efforts must be recognized.</p>
          <p><strong>🧠</strong> If I were in Endeavor’s position, I’d try to become the kind of father my children needed.</p>
          <p>And let’s not forget the civilians. They have been affected by the chaos. Many no longer trust heroes. If confidence isn’t restored, society won’t survive the next wave of villain attacks.</p>
          <p><strong>🎙️ Reporter’s Reflection:</strong> The future of heroism is uncertain. But if the new generation keeps fighting for justice, we might still have hope.</p>

          <h2>Live Report</h2>
          <p><strong>LIVE REPORT: The World of My Hero Academia!</strong></p>
          <p>Right now, we’re going to follow a young boy, Izuku Midoriya, who is preparing to become the world’s greatest hero. In a society where 80% of people have superpowers—called Quirks—those who don't must face many challenges. And Midoriya? He didn’t have a Quirk… until he got one from the No. 1 Hero, All Might!</p>
          <p><strong>💡 TIP:</strong> If someone doesn’t have a Quirk, they must train harder to keep up!</p>
          <p>So what’s happening next? Well, Midoriya is joining U.A. High School, a place where students are trained to become pro heroes. If he fails, he won’t get a license. But if he works hard, he will succeed.</p>
          <p><strong>🔁 Zero Conditional:</strong> If heroes lose focus, they get hurt.<br>
          <strong>💥 First Conditional:</strong> If Midoriya studies and trains, he’ll improve fast.</p>
          <p>At U.A., students mustn’t use their Quirks recklessly. They have to follow strict rules, but they don’t have to be perfect—just brave and improving.</p>
          <p><strong>❓Second Conditional:</strong> If villains weren’t so powerful, heroes wouldn’t need to risk their lives every day.</p>
          <p>Midoriya often thinks, "What should I do if someone is in danger?" His answer: “Save them—no matter what.”</p>
          <p><strong>⚠️ Cause tip:</strong> If fear takes over, mistakes are made. Heroes must stay calm under pressure.</p>
          <p>During battles, support items are used, strategies are shared, and teamwork gets rewarded. Hero society has been shaped by sacrifice and justice. Still, if society keeps relying too much on heroes, it might collapse.</p>
          <p><strong>💭 Reporter’s Note:</strong> If I were a hero, I’d train with Midoriya. He has heart, and that’s what the world needs most.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our English IV final project! We hope you enjoyed the journey through grammar, storytelling, and the world of <em>My Hero Academia</em>.</p>
      <p>This project was made with effort, creativity, and teamwork. It shows how English can be practiced in fun and meaningful ways. Every section used grammar structures we learned in class—from past events to future goals, from daily routines to imagined situations.</p>
      <p>We also learned that, just like in My Hero Academia, collaboration, courage, and improvement are keys to success in both language learning and life.</p>
